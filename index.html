        <h2>About me</h2>
        <hr>
        <img id="image_me" src="assets/images/lizethvera.jpg" alt="My picture"> 
        <p> I was born and brought up in a big family in Colombia.   
            The school days offered me a lot to learn. Subjects like algebra, drawing and history were of special interest to me. 
            Although I was good at studies throughout my academic life, sports, drawing, numbers, etc., interested me the most. I was more inclined towards understanding the concepts rather than just memorizing them.

        Some funny facts about me: 
        </p> 
        
        <ul> 
            <li>I get cold easily. Winter is a particularly difficult time for me. Thick fluffy oversized sweaters and coffee are elementary for my survival!</li>
            
            <li>I don't watch TV, But I enjoy going to the cinema. I usually pick out movies with a twist. I want the endings to surprise me, happy or not.</li>
            
            <li>My beliefs have nothing to do with religion. I believe in ethics, not in the church.</li>
            
            <li> I'm afraid of heights. That's why I've allways been on a roller coaster ride hahaha. Frecuently i am the person who organized the plans to go, just for the experience.  But the heights really scare me. </li>
        </ul>
